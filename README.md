# **V**oyager - A Laravel Admin & BREAD System

*What is BREAD?* 

Glad you asked. It's the same concept as CRUD which stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. 

BREAD stands for **Browse**, **Read**, **Edit**, **Add**, & **Delete**). It sounds much nicer too, right? It's much better to have a bunch of BREAD, than a bunch of CRUD. Documentation coming soon...
